<p>🔭 I’m currently working on MM12 as Fullstack Developer with Typescript (angular), Ionic, Firebase and Node.js.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning React, React Native and Node.js.</p>
<p>⚡ Fun fact: My first job was at IBM as a young apprentice, there i decided to go to the IT area and years later i returned as an intern, being promoted 6 months later to being hired.</p>
<p>::memo: I'm 24 years old, i'm passionate about technology and games, i'm proactive and a fan of fast deliveries. I love working with clients and seeing my work in production. I work as a PJ and i aim to specialize more and more and one day go to Canada.</p>
